The Code2000 download has been freely available and fully functional all along. It is an inexpensive shareware, though, and registration fees are much needed and much appreciated.

The registration fee for Code2000 is a "one-time" fee and registered users are considered to be registered for all newer versions.

Users are required to register the font after a "reasonable" evaluation period if they like the font and continue to use it. However, determining what is "reasonable" is left for the user to decide. The Code2000 download doesn't degrade or expire and there are no annoying pop-up screens. This has been left open-ended intentionally. In some cases, members of minority script user communites -- those who need a font like Code2000 the most -- can least afford it. Clearly, if registering the font means your family doesn't get enough food on the table, even for one meal, then it is not reasonable to register the font.

But, if you can afford the small fee, and you like the font and continue to use it after a reasonable evaluation period, then register your shareware! After all, I need food on my plate, too.

The single user/single site fee is just US$5.

More fee information can be found in the HTML file included in CODE2000.ZIP.
